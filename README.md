# Járngreipr 🧤

**A modern, customizable Android launcher designed for the AYN Thor (and other dual screen devices).**

Járngreipr is a sleek, gamepad-friendly
launcher that features beautiful themes, custom wallpapers,
and an intuitive interface optimized for the bottom screen of any dual screen Android device. 
It is recommended to be used with [Mjolnir](https://github.com/blacksheepmvp/mjolnir), 
an app that allows you to transform your Home button into a powerful dual-screen controller.

Just as **Thor** needs his iron gloves, **Járngreipr** 🧤, to safely wield **Mjolnir** 🔨, 
this launcher helps you grip control of your Thor device's bottom screen.
